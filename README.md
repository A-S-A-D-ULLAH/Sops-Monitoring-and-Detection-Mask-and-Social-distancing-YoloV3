# Sops-Monitoring-and-Detection-YoloV5
To stop the spread of covid-19, we want to practice SOP’s. Standard operating procedures (SOP’s) are a recommended solution by WHO to stop the expend of Corona Virus and ensure the safety of every individual in society. Our project is a step to minimize the contact of individuals with each other’s in different social gathering places. In this project our main goal is to detect the persons in a video which are not following SOPs in different places.

There are different ways to reduce the contact of persons with each other’s, for example close all gathering places. But if we do not want to close the places then it is our task to detect every person in the place and keep eye on them and check whatever the persons following SOP’s or not. For this task we are using video processing Computer Vision and machine learning concepts. We described the problem in abstract that how to ensure that peoples following SOP’s or not in any social gathering place. For this the possible solution is SOP’s detection program that detects every individual with respect to another individual and ensures social distancing is maintained or every single person having face mask, and no one would handshake with each other.

Social distancing is a strategy used to control the expending of covid-19. As the name suggests, social distancing implies that individuals should physically distance themselves from one another, reducing close contact, and thereby reducing the spread of this contagious disease.
This project is used in other fields of surveillance like sports, security checking, and crowd analysis.
